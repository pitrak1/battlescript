## Loops And Conditionals

Battlescript supports all of the loops and conditionals you would expect from Python:

1. `if`/`elif`/`else`
2. `while`
3. `for` including support for `range`

These function like they do in Python and are more or less self explanatory.  For examples of these, refer to the tests file (here)[https://github.com/pitrak1/battlescript/blob/main/BattlescriptTests/E2E/VariableTypes/VariableTypesTests.cs]
